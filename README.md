# sw_detonation
This is a git repo for the shock wave detonation project at Tsinghua University.

Please note that this version of the project was designed for ubuntu distribution.

## Usage
###### Note: Before using, make sure that the "/src" folder is in the matlab path.
The "/examples" folder contains examples for basic use. In short:
  - polar_plotting contains polar plotting examples
  - CO2_to_CH4 contains plots for CO2->CH4 refraction, including refraction system limits.
  - lag_particle_rre contains plots of theoretical evolutions of Lagrangian particles in an RRE pattern.


## Chemistry
Chemical kinetics simulations can be run from `chemistry` folder.

## Example
Example is given for CO_2 // CH_4 interface; other interfaces are gathered in the `plots_src` folder.

## Plot source codes
Some plots on which we focused on are grouped in the "/plots_src" folder.
