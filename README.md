# sw_detonation
This is a git repo for the shock wave detonation project at Tsinghua University.

Please note that this version of the project was designed for ubuntu distribution. As my internship ended in 2020, this repo is no longer updated. You might want to fork it on your own github profile so that this version remains for reference.

## Usage
###### Note: Before using, make sure that the "/src" folder is in the matlab path.
The "/examples" folder contains examples for basic use. In short:
  - polar_plotting contains polar plotting examples
  - CO2_to_CH4 contains plots for CO2->CH4 refraction, including refraction system limits.
  - lag_particle_rre contains plots of theoretical evolutions of Lagrangian particles in an RRE pattern.

## Chemistry
Chemical kinetics simulations can be run from `chemistry` folder.

## Example
Example is given for CO_2 // CH_4 interface; other interfaces are gathered in the `plots_src` folder.

## Plot source codes
Some plots on which we focused on are grouped in the "/plots_src" folder.
It also contains the scripts used to plot several regime diagrams, in particular for the iso-octane interface.
Each '*.m' file has a caption that explains its main purpose and functions.
